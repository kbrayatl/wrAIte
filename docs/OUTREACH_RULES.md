## Core Philosophy

Write like a human who did their homework. Lead with insight. Make it easy to say yes.

## Writing Rules

### Format Constraints

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Under 90 words** (cold email) | 81% of emails read on mobile. No scrolling. |
| **1-3 sentences per paragraph** | Bulky paragraphs cause cognitive strain. |
| **Generous whitespace** | Makes content scannable and less intimidating. |
| **No pleasantries** | "Hope you're well" is wasted space. Get to the why. |

### Language Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Flesch Reading Score: 80+** | 54% of adults read below 6th-grade level. |
| **Active voice only** | More direct, easier to understand. |
| **No adverbs** | Weakens writing. Show, don't tell. |
| **No jargon or buzzwords** | Triggers "incoming pitch" alarm. |
| **Calm confidence** | Not salesy, not eager. Helpful peer tone. |
| **Dependency grammar** | Keep related words close together for natural flow. |

### Banned Words and Phrases

Never use these—they scream "AI wrote this" or "sales pitch incoming":

**Corporate jargon:**
- synergy
- leverage
- streamline
- revolutionize
- game-changer
- cutting-edge
- best-in-class
- robust
- scalable
- end-to-end
- unlock
- empower
- drive (as verb for results)
- align
- partnership (when you mean sale)

**AI tells:**
- additionally
- therefore
- however
- furthermore
- moreover
- in conclusion
- crucial

**Sales clichés:**
- I hope this finds you well
- just following up
- circling back
- reach out (use "contact" or "message")
- excited to share
- delighted
- thrilled
- passionate about
- deep dive
- move the needle
- low-hanging fruit
- wheelhouse
- bandwidth
- take this offline
- happy to help
- per my last email
- as per our conversation
- touching base

## Message Structures

### 1. Observation-Bridge-Proof
**Use for:** Cold outreach, prospecting, LinkedIn

```
[Specific observation about their business—proves you did research]

[Bridge question: "Ever wish..." or "What if you could..."]

[Social proof: Someone at Company + result, without pain/cost]

[Soft ask: "Open to hearing how?" or "Worth a look?"]
```

**Example:**
> Subject: your I-85 routes
>
> Noticed you run deliveries through Atlanta's northeast corridor.
>
> A logistics manager at a similar operation cut 14% off fuel costs last quarter. Didn't add a single truck.
>
> He just started seeing things in his fleet data he'd been missing.
>
> Open to a quick look at how?

---

### 2. Answer-Advance
**Use for:** Email replies

```
[Answer their question in the first sentence]

[Brief context if needed]

[One new piece of value or insight]

[Clear next step or question]
```

---

### 3. Give-Give-Ask
**Use for:** Networking, job inquiries, personal outreach

```
[Genuine observation or compliment—not flattery]

[Something useful to them—insight, resource, connection offer]

[Small ask or open door—easy to say yes to]
```

---

### 4. Problem-Proof-Path
**Use for:** Presentations, proposals, executive summaries

```
[Their problem stated in their words]

[Evidence it's solvable—specific example or data]

[What the path forward looks like]
```

---

### 5. Insight-Implication-Invitation
**Use for:** Follow-ups, voicemails

```
[One insight relevant to them]

[What it means for their situation]

[Simple invitation to continue conversation]
```

---

### 6. Rejection-Curiosity-Reframe
**Use for:** Follow-up after objection/rejection

```
[Validate their position—don't fight it]

[Name the two likely reasons for the objection]

[Ask which one applies—genuinely curious, not challenging]
```

**Example:**
> Makes perfect sense you've already got a handle on this.
>
> Usually this means one of two things: you've got a similar solution in place and I didn't do a good job showing how we're different, or you're attacking this priority through a completely different approach.
>
> Can I ask which one fits your situation?

**Key principle:** When someone objects, they're usually objecting to your *approach*, not the *outcome*. Don't fall back to restating the outcome ("You don't want to save money?"). Find out which objection type applies:
1. They don't believe you can drive the outcome
2. They believe a different approach will work better

## Medium-Specific Constraints

| Medium | Word Limit | Key Rules |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Cold email** | <90 words | Observation-Bridge-Proof. Soft CTA. |
| **Follow-up email** | <75 words | Reference previous touch. One new insight. |
| **Email reply** | Match theirs ±20% | Answer first sentence. Then advance. |
| **LinkedIn connection** | <300 characters | No pitch. Just be human. |
| **LinkedIn DM** | <50 words | Conversational. No selling first touch. |
| **Voicemail** | <30 seconds | One hook. One question. Number twice. |
| **Presentation slides** | 6-8 words/headline | One idea per slide. Fragments only. |
| **Executive summary** | 3-5 paragraphs | Their problem first. Clear next step. |
| **Proposal** | Varies | Reflect their words. Quantified outcomes. |

---

## Tone by Relationship

| Relationship | Tone |
|--------------|------|
| **Cold** | Curious peer. You noticed something. Offering perspective, not pitching. |
| **Warm** | Familiar. Reference past interaction. Build on it. |
| **Active opportunity** | Direct partner. Focused on their timeline and decision. |
| **Current customer** | Trusted advisor. Their success is your success. |
| **Expansion** | Appreciative. Acknowledge what's working before suggesting more. |
| **Personal/networking** | Humble, curious. You're asking for their time—make it easy to say yes. |

---

## Subject Line Rules

**Philosophy:** Boring = curiosity. Salesy = delete.

**Good subject lines:**
- One word or short fragment
- Reference something specific about them
- Sounds like it could be from a colleague
- Creates genuine curiosity

**Bad subject lines:**
- "How to supercharge your pipeline in 90 days" (screams pitch)
- "Quick question" (overused, feels manipulative)
- Emojis or ALL CAPS
- Long and descriptive

**Examples:**
- "your I-85 routes"
- "driver hours"
- "maintenance timing"
- "re: Atlanta expansion"
- "quick thought on [specific thing]"

## Quality Checklist

Before sending, verify:

- [ ] Under word limit for medium?
- [ ] 1-3 sentences per paragraph?
- [ ] No banned words?

- [ ] Would I open this if I received it?
- [ ] Does it sound like a human wrote it?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Outcome Trap
❌ "Just to confirm—closing more deals faster isn't a priority?"

This insults their intelligence. Of course they want the outcome. They're objecting to your approach.

### The Feature Dump
❌ "Our platform offers AI-powered analytics, real-time tracking, automated reporting..."

Nobody cares about features. They care about their problems.

### The Fake Personalization
❌ "I noticed you're in the logistics industry..."

This is generic. Real personalization references something specific only they would recognize.

### The Eager Beaver
❌ "I'd love to hop on a quick call to show you how we can help!"

Sounds desperate. Calm confidence wins.

### The Wall of Text
❌ Long paragraphs with no breaks

Causes cognitive strain. Use whitespace.

## Output Rules

1. **Generate 3 variations** unless specified otherwise
2. Each variation should feel like a **different person** wrote it
3. Same core message, **different voice and approach**
4. Format variations clearly with separators
