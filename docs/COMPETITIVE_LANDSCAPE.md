3. **Personalization arms race** — Scraping LinkedIn, news, intent signals for context
4. **Consolidation** — Platforms trying to be all-in-one (CRM + sequences + AI + data)
5. **Coaching vs. Generation** — Split between tools that help you write vs. write for you

---

## Differentiation Opportunities

### Where competitors fall short:

1. **AI slop** — Most tools still produce content that sounds robotic/salesy
2. **No methodology** — They throw AI at the problem without a framework
3. **Email-only** — Few support LinkedIn, presentations, voicemails, proposals
4. **Opaque pricing** — Enterprise tools hide behind "contact sales"
5. **Generic** — Not customizable per company/persona

### Your potential moat:

1. **Framework-first** — Observation-Bridge-Proof, rejection handling, etc.
2. **Human-sounding** — Banned words, dependency grammar, Flesch score
3. **Multi-medium** — Email, LinkedIn, slides, voicemails, proposals
4. **Transparent pricing** — Simple tiers, no sales call required
5. **Customizable** — Company configs, personas, proof points
